# E-Commerce Backend  

## Description  
This program will let you make a SQL Database and manage products into categories, and attach tags to them for better sorting! It can also allow for the addition of new products, tags, and categories, along with the ability to update and delete them as needed!  

## Usage

**Before starting, be sure to create a .env file with your mySQL data inside the directory so that this program can function!**

1: Download this repo to any empty directory  
2: Navigate to this directory in git bash  
3: Type "npm install" to install all the packs required  
4: Login to your mysql account with "mysql -u root -p"  
5: type "SOURCE db/schema.sql"  
6: type "quit"  
7: type "npm run seed" *(optional, only if you need default/example data filled into the database)*  
8: type "npm start"  

From this point, your database will be live on the localhost with the port you specify, or 3001 by default. You can view and test it from there with programs like Insomnia.
